abstract = {The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the sole bidirectional gateway for nucleocytoplasmic transport. Despite recent progress in elucidating the NPC symmetric core architecture, the asymmetrically decorated cytoplasmic face, essential for messenger RNA (mRNA) export and a hotspot for nucleoporin-associated diseases, has remained elusive. Here we report a composite structure of the human cytoplasmic face obtained by combining biochemical reconstitution, crystal structure determination, docking into cryo–electron tomographic reconstructions, and physiological validation. Whereas species-specific motifs anchor an evolutionarily conserved ~540-kilodalton heterohexameric cytoplasmic filament nucleoporin complex above the central transport channel, attachment of the NUP358 pentameric bundles depends on the double-ring arrangement of the coat nucleoporin complex. Our composite structure and its predictive power provide a rich foundation for elucidating the molecular basis of mRNA export and nucleoporin diseases.}}

abstract = {Finding the relationship between two coordinate systems using pairs of measurements of the coordinates of a number of points in both systems is a classic photogrammetric task. It finds applications in stereophotogrammetry and in robotics. I present here a closed-form solution to the least-squares problem for three or more points. Currently various empirical, graphical, and numerical iterative methods are in use. Derivation of the solution is simplified by use of unit quaternions to represent rotation. I emphasize a symmetry property that a solution to this problem ought to possess. The best translational offset is the difference between the centroid of the coordinates in one system and the rotated and scaled centroid of the coordinates in the other system. The best scale is equal to the ratio of the root-mean-square deviations of the coordinates in the two systems from their respective centroids. These exact results are to be preferred to approximate methods based on measurements of a few selected points. The unit quaternion representing the best rotation is the eigenvector associated with the most positive eigenvalue of a symmetric 4 {\texttimes} 4 matrix. The elements of this matrix are combinations of sums of products of corresponding coordinates of the points.},

abstract = {Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is one of the key techniques that break the classical resolution limit in optical imaging. It is based on taking multiple recordings of a sample, each showing only a sparse arrangement of spatially well separated fluorescent molecules which can be localized at nanometer precision. While localizing along the lateral directions is usually straightforward, estimating axial positions at a comparable precision is known to be much harder, which is due to the relatively large depth of focus provided by the microscope optics. Whenever a molecule is sufficiently close to the coverslip, it becomes feasible to draw additional information from near field coupling effects: super-critical angle fluorescence (SAF) appears and can be exploited to boost the axial localization precision. Here we propose defocused imaging as a SMLM strategy that is capable of leveraging the information contained in SAF. We show that, regarding axial localization precision, our approach is superior to established SAF-based approaches. At the same time it is simple and can be conducted on any research-grade microscope where controlled defocusing on the order of a few hundred nanometers is possible.},

    abstract = {Single Molecule Localization super-resolution Microscopy (SMLM) has become a powerful tool to study cellular architecture at the nanometer scale. In SMLM, single fluorophore labels are made to repeatedly switch on and off (“blink”), and their exact locations are determined by mathematically finding the centers of individual blinks. The image quality obtainable by SMLM critically depends on efficacy of blinking (brightness, fraction of molecules in the on-state) and on preparation longevity and labeling density. Recent work has identified several combinations of bright dyes and imaging buffers that work well together. Unfortunately, different dyes blink optimally in different imaging buffers, and acquisition of good quality 2- and 3-color images has therefore remained challenging. In this study we describe a new imaging buffer, OxEA, that supports 3-color imaging of the popular Alexa dyes. We also describe incremental improvements in preparation technique that significantly decrease lateral- and axial drift, as well as increase preparation longevity. We show that these improvements allow us to collect very large series of images from the same cell, enabling image stitching, extended 3D imaging as well as multi-color recording.},

abstract = {Estimation of a parameter of interest from image data represents a task that is commonly carried out in single molecule microscopy data analysis. The determination of the positional coordinates of a molecule from its image, for example, forms the basis of standard applications such as single molecule tracking and localization-based super-resolution image reconstruction. Assuming that the estimator used recovers, on average, the true value of the parameter, its accuracy, or standard deviation, is then at best equal to the square root of the Cram\'{e}r--Rao lower bound. The Cram\'{e}r--Rao lower bound can therefore be used as a benchmark in the evaluation of the accuracy of an estimator. Additionally, as its value can be computed and assessed for different experimental settings, it is useful as an experimental design tool. This tutorial demonstrates a mathematical framework that has been specifically developed to calculate the Cram\'{e}r--Rao lower bound for estimation problems in single molecule microscopy and, more broadly, fluorescence microscopy. The material includes a presentation of the photon detection process that underlies all image data, various image data models that describe images acquired with different detector types, and Fisher information expressions that are necessary for the calculation of the lower bound. Throughout the tutorial, examples involving concrete estimation problems are used to illustrate the effects of various factors on the accuracy of parameter estimation and, more generally, to demonstrate the flexibility of the mathematical framework.},

abstract = {Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is one of the fastest evolving and most broadly used super-resolving imaging techniques in the biosciences. While image recordings could take up to hours only ten years ago, scientists are now reaching for real-time imaging in order to follow the dynamics of biology. To this end, it is crucial to have data processing strategies available that are capable of handling the vast amounts of data produced by the microscope. In this article, we report on the use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for localizing particles in three dimensions on the basis of single images. In test experiments conducted on fluorescent microbeads, we show that the precision obtained with a CNN can be comparable to that of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is the accepted gold standard. Regarding speed, the CNN performs with about 22k localizations per second more than three orders of magnitude faster than the MLE algorithm of ThunderSTORM. If only five parameters are estimated (3D position, signal and background), our CNN implementation is currently slower than the fastest, recently published GPU-based MLE algorithm. However, in this comparison the CNN catches up with every additional parameter, with only a few percent extra time required per additional dimension. Thus it may become feasible to estimate further variables such as molecule orientation, aberration functions or color. We experimentally demonstrate that jointly estimating Zernike mode magnitudes for aberration modeling can significantly improve the accuracy of the estimates.},
